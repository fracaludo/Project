# Project
CH-200 project: We would like to rank a list of molecules accordind to their nucleophilicity/electrophilicity. To do so we've installed xtb and use morfeus package to calculate the fukui electrophiliciy and nucleophilicity of each atom in every molecule. Finally we wanted to display the ranked molecules in 3D and highlight the nu/el sites on them.
